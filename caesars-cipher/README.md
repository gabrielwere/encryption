### CAESAR'S CIPHER

Caesar's encryption algorithm in Go.<br>
The algorithm assumes characters being encrypted are part of the English alphabet i.e (A-Z)(a-z).<br>
It also assumes right shifting:

###### Example

`Using a shift key of 3`

| Plain text  | Cipher text |
| ----------- |:-----------:|
|      a      |        d    |
|      d      |        g    |
|      x      |        a    |
