### ATBASH CIPHER

Atbash encryption algorithm in Go.<br>
The algorithm assumes characters being encrypted are part of the English alphabet i.e (A-Z)(a-z).<br>
Since it is an affine cipher that has one alphabet,the encryption function can also be used for decryption.

###### Example

| Plain text  | Cipher text |
| ----------- |:-----------:|
|      a      |        z    |
|      d      |        w    |
|      x      |        c    |
|      n      |        m    |
|      i      |        r    |
